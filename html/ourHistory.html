<h5>Supporting awareness, education and access to hearing treatment around the world. </h5>
<p class="para">Cochlear Foundation was established in 2005, driven by a desire to help more people hear. To accomplish this, we aim to reduce the <br> impact of hearing loss on individuals and societies. <br><br>

    Hearing health is an issue that affects many of us, and it’s impacting more people every day. According to the World Health <br> Organization, approximately 1.5 billion people live with some degree of hearing loss, and that’s projected to grow to 2.5 billion by <br> 2050. <span class="span1">1</span> <br><br>
    
    Today, 60 million people live with severe to complete hearing loss. <span class="span1">1</span> <br><br>
    
    Yet this issue fails to rank as a priority in many societies. Those with hearing loss, especially in communities where hearing services <br> are under resourced, often find it harder to participate in school or find a job. <br><br>
    
    We aim for a world where everyone can access hearing treatment and a life rich with potential. To achieve this, we have helped to fund <br> more than 120 projects across the world supporting thousands of children and adults with hearing loss, along with hearing health <br> professionals who are dedicated to helping them hear.
