    <h2>Supporting the <span class="span">Global Foundation for Children with Hearing Loss</span> </h2>
    <p class="para1">With funding support from Cochlear Foundation, the Global Foundation for Children with Hearing Loss developed and executed a <br> training program for auditory-verbal therapy, so more of Vietnam’s children with hearing loss can develop listening and speaking <br> skills.

            <p class="para2">Auditory-verbal therapy is a method for <br> teaching children with profound hearing <br> loss to listen and speak using their hearing <br> technology, such as hearing aids or <br> hearing implants. It focuses on listening <br> skills to improve communication. With <br> early intervention, this therapy helps offer <br> children with hearing loss access to the <br> same opportunities and an equal start in <br> life as hearing children.</p>

<p class="para1">The Global Foundation delivered the milestone development of a national standard training curriculum for Vietnam. This means that <br> there’s a permanent program in place to ensure ongoing training, backed by the Vietnam government’s Ministry of Education and <br> Training. As a result, the children of Vietnam should have increased access to therapy as more training is offered. <br><br>

    The program started by providing in-country instruction and online coaching in 2018 to improve and expand the skills of the country’s <br> auditory-verbal therapists. This training became the framework for upskilling others, expanding access to therapy for more children <br> going forward.  The foundation also hosted events for children  and their carers with lectures, discussions, and group activities to give <br> parents skills and strategies to practise at home and understand child development markers. 
    </p>

    <h2>Improving hearing outcomes for future generations</h2>
    <p class="para1">Hospital screening and monitoring is critical for early diagnosis of hearing loss, given the higher rates occurring in intensive care units and neonatal intensive care patients, compared to standard baby nurseries. Low awareness and understanding of hearing loss may sometimes lead to misdiagnosing children with autism or other issues.  <br><br>

        To help, the Global Foundation provided training for Vietnam National Children’s Hospital’s audiology team to use hearing equipment to perform various real ear tests and measurements. This equipment also ensures accurate and optimal fitting of hearing aids in children. 
        
        </p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p class="para1">Since starting the program, the Global Foundation has trained over 220 teachers, 270 families and 125 health professionals. The program is already benefitting over 1,000 children with disabling hearing loss. </p>
