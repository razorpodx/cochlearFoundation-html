        <h2>Supporting the Shepherd Centre </h2>

    <p>When detected early and treated, children with hearing loss have a better chance of speaking, learning and developing, thus <br> improving their ability to gain an education and reach their full potential <span class="span">1,2</span> .  Early treatment of hearing loss can help a child’s <br> development stay on par with their hearing peers, offering them more opportunities to excel in life<span class="span">1,2</span> . <br><br>

        Based in Australia, the Shepherd Centre gives children with hearing loss the tools they need to learn, listen and speak. <br><br>
        
        Cochlear Foundation funding contributed towards the centre’s research team, therapists and hearing health professionals to help <br> identify methods for improving treatment and care for the hearing loss community. <br><br>
        
        Recently, these efforts have focused on delivering research programs to further understanding of hearing loss and treatment outcomes, as well as implementing online treatment <br> resources that aim to help children with hearing loss speak, learn and develop.</p> <br><br>
    
        <h3>How a local approach benefits the global community</h3>
    
    <p>At the heart of the Shepherd Centre are the ground-breaking clinical tools, resources and education programs they’ve developed for <br> professionals and families across Australia. Their early intervention program is world-renowned for its results – more than 90 per cent of children who graduate from their program attend school with listening and language skills on par <br> with those of their hearing <peers class="span">3</peers>  <br><br>

        To help children with hearing loss in rural and remote locations who live too far to attend in-person treatment, the centre developed <br> online services. Seeing the impressive results through their online platform in Australia, they then looked at ways to help children and <br> their families internationally. As a result, they developed HearHub, a world-first online platform that can deliver their services to <br> children worldwide.

    <h3>Never losing focus on the role and reach of research</h3>
<p>Beyond providing children and their families with access to these critical tools, HearHub deliversa rich source of data for the <br> Shepherd Centre’s ongoing research. Using this information, they plan on reviewing and identifying new frontiers, including analysing <br> different hearing technology and therapies, improving social skills in toddlers, and measuring the effectiveness of <br> online delivery of their services. </p><br><br>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Since Cochlear Foundation first provided funding in 2014, the Shepherd Centre has seen enrolments jump from 450 families in 2017 <br> to 729 families as of May 2020. Their ongoing research and service offering has led to improved results for children who receive early <br> intervention, showing they perform better on social cognition measures than ten years ago <span class="span">4</span> . </p>
