        <h2>Supporting <span class="sapn1">Malala Fund</span> </h2>
        <p>Malala Fund and Cochlear Foundation have joined forces to raise awareness of the needs of millions of girls, children and young <br> people  with hearing loss worldwide. Together, we will promote their equal rights to an education and early access to hearing <br> treatment. <br><br>

            Early access to better hearing can help children speak, learn, and develop, significantly improving their ability to gain an education <br> and realise their full potential. <span class="span">1,2</span>. <br><br>
            
            However, worldwide 34 million children have disabling hearing loss. <span class="span">3</span> If not hearing loss is not treated early on, children often <br> experience a slow progression throughout their academic life, including lower school performance, higher risk of dropping out of <br> school, and less likelihood of accessing higher education4. Ultimately, this can hamper their lifelong career prospects.<span class="span">3</span> <br><br>
            
            This problem is exacerbated in many parts of the world where children – especially girls – already face significant barriers to <br> education. <span class="span">5</span> 
            </p> <br>

            <h3>Promoting equal rights to education for girls, children and young people  with hearing loss</h3> <br>

            <p>At age 15, Malala Yousafazi was attacked by the Taliban for speaking out for girls’ education. In 2013 she co-founded Malala Fund <br> with her father, Ziauddin. A year later, Malala received the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of her efforts to see every girl complete <br> 12 years of free, safe, quality education. The fund continues to champion this mission. <br><br>

                Malala who has personal experience of hearing loss and has a cochlear implant added her voice to the hearing health cause by writing <br> a personal foreword for the World Health Organization’s first World Report on Hearing in 2021. In the report she said that with all the <br> barriers to equality facing girls, women and other marginalized people, those who need hearing care are further disadvantaged and <br> too often left behind. </p> <br>

    <h3>Three paths that lead to change</h3> <br>
    <p>Throughout our three-year partnership, Malala Fund and Cochlear Foundation we aspire to remove hearing loss as a barrier to life’s <br> opportunities – ensuring girls, children and young people can gain an education and realise their ability to thrive throughout their life. <br> To achieve this, we will: <br><br>
 
     1.	Parents: Appeal to parents to check and if needed, treat their child’s hearing loss from early childhood to make sure hearing loss <br> doesn’t hamper their personal development, ability to access education and realise their full potential. <br><br> 
     
     2.	Hearing health community: Join forces with hearing health non-government organisations (NGOs) and advocacy organisations to <br> collectively raise awareness of the needs of millions of children with hearing loss worldwide. We’ll promote their equal rights to an <br> education and early access to hearing treatment. <br><br>
     
     3.	Governments and societies: Support a growing global call for governments and societies to prioritise hearing health, providing <br> children access to the most appropriate hearing treatments so they can speak, learn, develop and realise their full potential. <br><br>
     
     Just as Malala inspires people everywhere through her amazing story of courage and persistence, we will work alongside Malala Fund <br> to inspire girls, children and young people  with hearing loss, encouraging them to gain an education, build self-esteem and realise <br> their full potential throughout their life. <br>
